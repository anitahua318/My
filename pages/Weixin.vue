            In 2019, I decided to come to the States. I was luckily accepted into my dream boarding school in Western Mass. To record my journey, I opened a blog account. The 14-year-old Anita wouldn't have known that this simple move gained her popularity amongst study-abroads, and made her a essay tutor, college counselor, and life coach of up to 400 students.
